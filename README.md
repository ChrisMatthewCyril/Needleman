BIMM 143 Project

Goal: To be able to take two gene sequences from two different organisms, and be able to predict whether they are orthologs.

This project has two phases: a setup and a test.

socrates.py is the brain of this project. I've used biopython to write methods.
BenchmarkMaker.py is the setup phase.

LOGIC BEHIND THE SETUP PHASE:
I'm comparing seqs between humans and fruitflies. [...] I'm sleepy now, melatonin levels are high... goodnight! ðŸ˜´
